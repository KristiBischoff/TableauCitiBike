# Tableau - Citi Bike Analytics

## Background and Task

![Citi-Bikes](Images/citi-bike-station-bikes.jpg)

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so my first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers. 

# Dashboard
Analysis conducted by gender, age, peak travel hours, and trip duration. Two maps were generated to highlight the prevalence of end and start station among travelers.
