# Tableau - Citi Bike Analytics

## Background and Task

![Citi-Bikes](Images/citi-bike-station-bikes.jpg)

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization along the East Coast. The bike data is collected each month, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, it would be interesting to see a dashboard that visualizes the data. This dashboard is a baseline understanding of the March 2020 Citi Bike data in order to prepare future analysis to identify trends in Citi Bike usage over time. Age categories, gender, and subscription status were of particular interest in order to identify trends of focus due to weather change and other influences that could impact Citi Bike usage. In general, past Citi Bike usage is of importance in order to forecast future customer use and to look at trends further. 

# Dashboard
Analysis conducted by gender, age, and subscription status. Two maps were generated to highlight the prevalence of end and start station among travelers. The dashboard is dynamic by categories in order to get a full picture of what subscriber demographics are vs. non-subscribers, demographics of those that started at a particular station vs. others, etc.
